            <p>
                This is necessary because GitHub has a 5000req/token/hour rate-limit which would be
                reached very quickly if you tried to analyze some of the bigger profiles on GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app is running with two tokens, which gives 10000 requests.
                The first 5000 requests can be used to build any profile, but the last 5000 requests are
                reserved for users building their own profile. To confirm that you're building your own
                profile, we check if you've starred the repository.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the app has been rate-limited (check lower right corner), please come back later
                or build the app locally and use your own tokens.
